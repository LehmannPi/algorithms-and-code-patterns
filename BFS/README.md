# Tree Algorithms in TypeScript

This project implements binary tree and N-ary tree data structures along with traversal algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `classes.ts` - Contains BinaryTreeNode and NaryTreeNode class definitions
- `bfs.ts` - Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithms for both tree types
- `main.ts` - Main entry point with example usage

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js and TypeScript installed:

## Compilation and Execution

To compile and run the project:

Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:

```bash
npx tsc main.ts
```

This will generate main.js (and other corresponding .js files)

Run the compiled JavaScript:

```bash
